# Variations of the nx2 puzzle and appropriate algorithms
Bachelor's Thesis by Viktor Rieß 
Goethe University Frankfurt, Department of Computer Science and Mathematics

An implementation of algorithms for solving 2-column sliding puzzles (n×2 puzzles) written in C++.  
Features a web application for playing the puzzle and visualizing the algorithms.
This project was developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis.
